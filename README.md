## About CryptoCloud

- CryptoCloud is a website that allows users to search and learn about various cryptocurrencies and non-fungible tokens (NFTs)

## Made with:

- Crypto API
- React
- CSS

## Functionality:

- Users of the app have the ability to place bids on items that are up for auction. Once a bid has been placed, the user is not able to delete the item.
- Users can search for different cryptocurrencies.
- You can create your own NFT: you just have to upload the NFT Image, give your NFT a name, upload a your user image, write your username, and decide how many etherium do you want your NFT to be worth!
- Implemented a popup section: When the user wants to delete an NFT a section pops up and asks if you really want to delete that particular NFT, also when you click anywhere outside of the popup section it disappears.
